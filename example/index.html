      The Frigate Bird is Antigua And Barbudas's national bird that happens to
      be black with a bright red chest. The male versions of the frigate bird
      expand their chest when trying to attract a mate. In Barbuda, there is a
      Frigate Bird Sanctuary which has an estimated population of 100,000 birds.
